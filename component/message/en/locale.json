This approach is a simple multi-attribute decision analysis method whereby digital maps (often called “spatial layers”) of restoration’s prospective benefits, such as enhanced wood harvest, carbon sequestration, or biodiversity conservation, are weighted according to the relative importance (i.e., rating) a user attaches to them. The tool creates a single weighted benefit layer by multiplying each benefit layer by its user-assigned weight and then summing across all the benefit layers. Next, it calculates a benefit-cost ratio by dividing the weighted benefit layer by the estimated costs of restoration, which like the benefits may vary across locations. Finally, it masks from the results any locations that the user has indicated are unsuitable for restoration due to ecological or socioeconomic risks. Users thus provide two important types of input before running the tool: the relative weights on different restoration benefits, and constraints that exclude specified locations from restoration.",
