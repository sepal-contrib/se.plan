- move __version__ file to root

## 1.1.0 (2023-09-21)

### Feat

- allow usage of same layer multiple times. - it will be useful when using continuous layers, i.e. multiple ranges can be selected. - instead of rendering the dashboard with the hardcoded info from the layers, I will use the one comming from the model, so it will remain interactive.
- allow download of all assets in the questionnaire
- close map info dialog on map if different drawer is used and be sure user has read that
- add waiting message
- set default zooms for map and reset event + center object when indexes are created
- set reset methods to both map and dashboard
- display a message with the full recipe path after saving
- improve recipe status and name display. - set recipe name on top of the app (appbar) - set recipe status after recipe name - update recipe "new_change" trait every time something has been edited.

- seplan_aoi improvements: AOI MODEL - new AoiModel inheriting from sepal_ui to add updated trait in the model after set the object. - replace clear attributes event to avoid remove updated trait - replace "name" as trigger trait from seplanaoi I used updated. - set map map event that will be listened by custom view and set after data is imported. - add reset method and add reset_view trait that will be listened by custom aoi view to reset widgets as well AOI VIEW - wrap parent methods to listen model instead to interact directly with the view

### Fix

- allow none on recipe. It will happen when the app just start at the beginning
- fix recipe schema
- update seplan_aoi model when model is resetted. - Once the sepal_ui.aoi_model is resetted, we have to update the "sepal_aoi" model so it can remove the feature collection from it and stop propagating it trough all the components"
