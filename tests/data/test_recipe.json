It varies by country and, for countries with sufficient data, by first-level administrative subdivision (e.g., state or province). The cost reported by the tool is the average for the country or subdivision. The actual cost at different locations within the country or subdivision could be higher or lower than the reported average estimate. In addition, compared to the estimates reported by the tool, se.plan team estimates that implementation cost is, on average, 45% higher if the restoration site is a forest that has been heavily damaged (for example, by fire, windthrow, or pest outbreak) and 66% lower if passive restoration, which relies on natural tree regeneration, is feasible. The tool contains a variable that predicts the likely success of natural regeneration."
